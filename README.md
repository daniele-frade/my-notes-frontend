<h2> My Notes App </h2>

My Notes App is a MERN stack application that allows the user to a list of personal notes (think of it as a simplified version of Evernote). At its core this is a CRUD app, where one can add, update and delete notes. Notes can also have multiple tags. 
Last but not least, the app implements authentication through a third party service, specifically, [OKTA](https://developer.okta.com/)
